    <h2>Stanley Dock</h2>
    <p>Millions of bricks, thousands of panes of glass and hundreds of steel girders constitute what was once part of the life blood of the thriving Port of Liverpool – the warehouses. 
    Rum and tobacco imported from exotic locations were stored here in great brick buildings, the size the world had never seen before. 
    The docks at the mouth of the Mersey River, including Stanley Dock, pioneered modern dock technology, transport and port management. Stanley Dock sits at the heart of these historic docks.
    The dock is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a key heritage asset for Liverpool city. <a href="https://stanleydock.com/history-heritage-stanley-dock-liverpool" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
