### Structure

In contact form I wanted to provide possibility to send email by emailJS. Footer stays collapsed regardless to screen size for easy acces. On map there are marked places with choosen points.

JS - Java Script - I've used Java Script to implement Google maps API and EmailJS API. [JavaScript wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

Bootstrap 4.4.1 - library that I've used to build responsive grid layout and as base for some smaller elements available [here](https://getbootstrap.com/)
