## UX

### User stories

* *As a person new to boating I want to see price ranges for new boats.*
* *As a person who is new to boating I want to go to talk with boat sellers and see building process.*

### Strategy

My goal was to build mobile friendly, responsive and interactive website with all the information easily accessible 
just scrolling up or down and with links whitin website.

### Scope

* For people who want to see how much different range of new boats cost I've provided online configurator/price checker.
* For people who want to talk with boat builders I wanted to provide possibility to travel with person who will oranise bus travel and meeting with representative of boat building company.
* For people who want to see marina and talk about mooring costs I wanted to provide possibility to travel with person who will organise bus travel and meeting with representative.
* For people who are looking for family day out I wanted to provide possibility to travel with guide to show and tell about history of old dock.
* For people who are looking for family day out I wanted to provide possibility to travel and organise trip with ferry on Mersey river.
* For people who have a boat and are looking for boating club I wanted to provide information about one of the oldest boating club and possibility to bus travel to meet other boaters.

### Structure

In contact form I wanted to provide possibility to send email by emailJS. Footer stays collapsed regardless to screen size for easy acces. On map there are marked places with choosen points.

## TECHNOLOGIES

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language - used for building basic structure of website, allows to view it on modern web brosers [official description](https://whatwg.org/)

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - adding styles to website like fonts, colours, layout etc. [official description](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

JS - Java Script - I've used Java Script to implement Google maps API and EmailJS API. [JavaScript wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

Bootstrap 4.4.1 - library that I've used to build responsive grid layout and as base for some smaller elements available [here](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Additional font from Google Fonts library (Lato) available [here](https://fonts.google.com/)

## FEATURES

Footer is sticky and it scrolls with website. 

### Features left to implement

In future I would like to add extended booking option with calendar showing which dates are available.
